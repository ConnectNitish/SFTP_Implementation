The Congresss alliance with three regional parties in Jharkhand, announced on Thursday, fits a template that could make it enduring. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha Prajatantrik and the Rashtriya Janata Dal have joined hands with the Congress, which sends 14 MPs to the Lok Sabha. The seat haring agreement gives seven seats to the Congress, four to the JMM, two to the JVM and one to the RJD. In turn, the JMM gets a larger share of seats in the Assembly election, that will also take place in 2019. In the 2014 Assembly election, the BJP won the State with 31 percent of the vote. Collectively, constituents of the new alliance got 47 percent of the vote. Alliances dont only turn on arithmetic. What makes this alliance potent is the synergy among its partners, with ground reports indicating that workers of these parties have developed a certain comfort level with one another. Collectively, they have command over all the regions, and appeal to all social groups of the State. As much as a third of the States population is tribal, and the alliance is expected to reach out to this section. These factors explain the sweep that the alliance of the Congress, the JMM, the RJD and the CPI had in 2004. That was the last time Jharkhand had a rainbow alliance, it won 13 of the 14 seats, while the BJP won only one seat, Koderma.
